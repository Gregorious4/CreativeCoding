To be honest I'm dissapointed with my final project. My internet went out for a large portion of Thursday, and having question forums not easily accessible via stack overflow or whatever slowed me down. It's late Friday, my brain is melted but whatever. I like where this project is going and I'm going to keep adding to it over winter break if only to say I successfully programmed a game in p5js.
