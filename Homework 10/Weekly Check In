I got all of the required mechanics to work. The random portion I used on the y coordinates of the triangle. It's hard to see but there are two points in the middle of the eyes that move side to side / up and down. I experiemented with changing colors and it caused everything to go black. I'm not sure why but I guess the colors did change.
