This week took me way too long. I did like 95% of the work in 5 minutes and then spent the next 3 hours trying to figure out what wasn't working. By trying stuff eventually I figured out that I had to put my functions that create shapes into another custom function as well as the draw function. I'm not sure why that's the case because it didn't look like you had to do that with your code. It might be because if statements can't be in a function that also gets drawn? I'm not sure.
