I didn't think The Last Lecture was very different from any other lecture given by someone who's not about to die. He addressed the fact that he was dying but didn't focus on it. He kept the message lighthearted but remained inspirational. He was a great speaker and I agree with the person that told him he was made to be a salesman. I did find it funny how old all of the tech they were using was. It's very cool that a lot of the stuff they were doing so long ago built what we use today. The primitive VR headsets for example have progressed a lot since then. Overall a great lecture. I couldn't help feel sad that the guy only had a few months left, but then again this video is old and he's been gone for a while.
