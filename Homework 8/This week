I finally figured out how to put things together in a folder so hopefully that helps you sort through my mess of a repository. Weekly check in: I got the boxes to focus and flash red correctly but the website crashes directly afterward. My guess is that I'll need to fix this next week. I would have done the extra credit but I got caught up in other homework and ran out of time.
