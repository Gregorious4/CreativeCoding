I got everything to work fine. I don't completely understand the mouse click function. Initially I had my player movement set to 3, and I couldn't figure out why my win condition wasn't working. After an hour of frustration I realized that because my win condition coordinate is so specific, a value that doesn't line up perfectly wouldn't function properly. So I changed the player movement value to 5 and it fixed the problem. I'm also not sure how to change the fill color of a specific shape, so I just changed the general fill color every time an obstacle hit a wall.
